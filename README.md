  I'm Sheila Bernice , but you can just call me Shyee.
    I am an Android & Web  Developer, residing in Kirinyaga County. 
Ever since i was a kid i have been a tireless seeker of knowledge.  Also,  fun fact am an Aries, and you know what they say about us,
    Once  determined to do something, nothing will stop an Aries. 
    My journey as a Developer began not so long ago when i joined Moringa School. 
    Everyday of code during my first days felt like a bad decision  but then with time it got easier to understand and easy to implement.
